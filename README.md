# Dynamic Dashboards with Plotly Dash

This repository provides a structured approach for building scalable Plotly Dashboards using Dash. It includes multiple dashboards with Plotly graphs and a structured way of adding algorithms.

## Overview

- Each dashboard is implemented in a modular way for easy management and scalability.
- Common components and utilities are shared across multiple dashboards for efficient development.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mominalix/Scalable-Dashboards-using-Dash-and-Plotly.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd dynamic-dashboards
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Program

1. Make sure you're in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated (if you created one).

2. Run the main application file:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8050` to view the Dashboards.
